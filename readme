        +--------------------------------+--------------------------------+

    It is strongly recommended that the user do a complete install of all 
    components to ensure that this driver works correctly.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
3. Installation
   
    3.1. Login as 'root' before executing the following instructions.
    
    3.2. Uncompress the driver
    # tar zxvf adv_17V35X-VerX.tar.gz
    
    3.3. Build the driver
      # cd adv_17V35X-VerX
      # make
    Note: 
      To compile the source code, you must install kernel development header 
      file package,"gcc" and "make" command.
    
    3.4. Install the driver module
    # make install
    to see whether ttyAPn ( n = 1,2,3...) exist in /dev/ folder,      
    or      
    #insmod ./adv17v35x.ko
    
    3.5. Uninstall the driver module and clean
    # make uninstall
    # make clean
    or 
    #rmmod adv17v35x
    
    3.6 Verify driver installation
    You may run command "dmesg" to check the latest status
    log reported by this driver whenever it's activated.
    
    This module registers Advantech ports as "/dev/ttyAP0", "/dev/ttyAP1", etc. 
    Use "minicom" or your custom serial application to test the ports       
    
    Attention! The name of PCIE-16XX ports are the same as Old cards which use 
    Oxford chip, so don't use them at the same time.  
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
4. Driver files and device naming convention
   
    The driver file may be obtained via email. The first step, anyway, is to
    copy driver file "adv_17V35X-VerX" into specified
    directory. e.g. /advantech. The execute commands as below.
    
    # cd /advantech/adv_17V35X-VerX
     
    You may find the driver source code in /advantech/adv_17V35X-VerX.
    
    Driver creates traditional serial device names, "/dev/ttyAP0" onwards.
    
    Device naming when multiple boards are installed
    -----------------------------------------------
    assuming 2 PCIE-1602 boards, 1 PCIE-1610 board and
    1 PCIE-1622 board.
    
    Board Num.	            Port Name
    1st board (1602)	    ttyAP0  - ttyAP1
    2nd board (1602)	    ttyAP2  - ttyAP3
    3rd board (1610)	    ttyAP4  - ttyAP7
    4th board (1622)	    ttyAP8  - ttyAP15
    
    Note. We don't know which card be found first, maybe 1602, or 1610, or 
    1622. This depends on the sequence that operating system scanning.
